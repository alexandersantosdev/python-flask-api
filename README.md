## A simple API using flask

    # Hi, my name is Alexander Roberto dos Santos and i'm a studant / developer.
    # I'm post graduate in web tecnologies and system analist.

    # I love python and python´s frameworks, javascript too.

    # How to use this app?

    # You have to install the libs contents in the requirements.txt and runs the app.py with python3

    # This app uses sqlalchemy to auxiliate with the database, i´d used sqlite3.

    # To serialize the objects returned from database as python objects, i´d used marshmallow

    # I tried to separate the folders in project like used in mvc projects (try)


    # This app runs on http://localhost:5000

    # To use the api in this app runs on http://localhost:5000/users using the HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE) you can use POSTMAN or INSOMINIA to test this app as well.

    # Sorry for ny english but, i´m trying to stay out the box in my Brazil, my beloved country.



    # Enjoy...
